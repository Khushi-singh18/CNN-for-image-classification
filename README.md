DOMAIN : MACHINE LEARNING 
DURATION : 4 WEEKS 
MENTOR : NEELA SANTOSH

*DESCRIPTION* : 

The goal of this task is to build a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using a deep learning framework like TensorFlow or PyTorch to perform image classification. CNNs are specialized neural networks that are particularly effective for recognizing patterns in images, such as edges, textures, and shapes.

âœ… What this task involves:
Dataset Selection:
Use a standard image dataset such as CIFAR-10, which contains 60,000 images across 10 classes (e.g., airplane, cat, car).

Model Architecture:
1.Design a CNN with layers like:
2.Convolutional layers (for feature extraction)
3.Pooling layers (for downsampling)
4.Dense (fully connected) layers (for classification)
Model Training:
*Train the model on the training data using an optimizer (like Adam) and loss function (like categorical crossentropy).
Evaluation:
*Test the model on unseen data and measure performance using accuracy and visualization (like accuracy graphs).
